abstract = {The emergent Optical Head-Mounted Display (OHMD) platform has made mobile reading possible by superimposing digital text onto users’ view of the environment. However, mobile reading through OHMD needs to be effectively balanced with the user’s environmental awareness. Hence, a series of studies were conducted to explore how text spacing strategies facilitate such balance. Through these studies, it was found that increasing spacing within the text can significantly enhance mobile reading on OHMDs in both simple and complex navigation scenarios and that such benefits mainly come from increasing the inter-line spacing, but not inter-word spacing. Compared with existing positioning strategies, increasing inter-line spacing improves mobile OHMD information reading in terms of reading speed (11.9\% faster), walking speed (3.7\% faster), and switching between reading and navigation (106.8\% more accurate and 33\% faster).},

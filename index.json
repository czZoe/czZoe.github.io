However, mobile reading through OHMD needs to be effectively balanced with the userâ€™s environmental awareness. Hence, a series of studies were conducted to explore how text spacing strategies facilitate such balance. Through these studies, it was found that increasing spacing within the text can significantly enhance mobile reading on OHMDs in both simple and complex navigation scenarios and that such benefits mainly come from increasing the inter-line spacing, but not inter-word spacing. Compared with existing positioning strategies, increasing inter-line spacing improves mobile OHMD information reading in terms of reading speed (11.9\\% faster), walking speed (3.7\\% faster), and switching between reading and navigation (106.8\\% more accurate and 33\\% faster).","tags":["Ubiquitous Information Processing"],"title":"Not All Spacings are Created Equal: The Effect of Text Spacings in On-the-go Reading Using Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhou Chen"],"categories":["Tutorial"],"content":"What is jamovi? jamovi is a free, open-source software that offers a point-and-click interface (GUI) for R. It was started by developers who worked on JASP. jamovi is built on top of R, and all the analyses it provides are written in R, and it could enter R code directly. Why we need jamovi? JASP can not perform ART (Aligned Rank Transform) ARTool only support Windows version and R version JASP has not been possible to enter R code directly or easily add custom plugin/module Our needs Complete all of the data analysis using one tool/language easily.{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out\u0026#34;} This tool has the similar GUI operation to the JASP for quick drawing of graphics.{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out\u0026#34;} It also supports custom plugins/modules for flexible expansion.{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out\u0026#34;} How to use jamovi and R together? There are two ways to use jamovi and R together.\nUse of the Rj Editor in jamovi Use the jmv R package in RStudio jamovi can also provide the equivalent R syntax for each analysis with Syntax mode.\nHow to use Rj Editor in jamovi Installation Enter Code Rj auto-suggests function names, like in RStudio. By default, Rj makes use of the version of R bundled with jamovi. This includes many packages.\nBut if you need to make use of additional R packages then youâ€™ll need to make use of the System R version.\nIf you select the configuration gear to the top right of the code box, youâ€™ll see an option to change the R version used. The System R uses the version of R you have installed. It has access to all of the packages you have installed for that version of R. The last thing you will need is to have the jmvconnect R package installed in your system R library. ART Demo Install packages from R terminal or RStudio # It allows system R version to access the jamovi datasets. install.packages(\u0026#39;jmvconnect\u0026#39;) # download and install the ARTool package install.packages(\u0026#34;ARTool\u0026#34;) How to use jamovi in RStudio Install jmv from R terminal or RStudio # jmv is the jamovi R package. install.packages(\u0026#39;jmv\u0026#39;) All the analyses included with jamovi are available from within R using this package. For examples on how to use jmv, jamovi can be placed in â€˜syntax modeâ€™. Syntax mode produces the R syntax required to reproduce jamovi analyses in R.
